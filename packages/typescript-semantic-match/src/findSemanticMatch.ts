/**
 * Semantic match finder for migration-style item lists.
 *
 * This module provides a helper that determines whether a "test item" is already present
 * in an existing list, even when names are different. In this context, a semantic match
 * means two labels point to the same underlying concept (for example, renamed fields,
 * wording changes, or synonyms).
 *
 * Matching strategy:
 * 1) Check for exact name equality.
 * 2) If no exact match exists, use an LLM to infer conceptual equivalence.
 *
 * The exported function returns the index of the first matching list item when a match
 * is found, or `-1` when no sufficiently similar item exists.

 * Finds the best semantic match for a test item within a list of items.

 *
 * The function first checks for an exact name match and returns its index immediately
 * if found.
 * If no exact match exists, it asks the LLM to decide whether the test item is represented
 * in the list under a different name and returns the index of the first matching list item,

 * @param itemlist The list of strings/items to compare.

 * a description of the items or the nature of the changes.
 * @returns The index of the first matching item from the list, or `-1` if no good match

You are a data analyst who has been hired to try to preserve the integrity of a list of
data items. The user will show you a list of items from a data migration, followed by 
a "test item". Your job is to determine whether the test item is already present in
the list (but maybe under a different name), or whether it is not present in the list
at all.

We've already determined that the test item does not have an exact name match in the list,
but it might have been renamed or expressed in a different way. 

Let me give you a few examples of what I mean by this:

- Imagine that the list is ["Customer ID", "Order Date", "Total Amount"], and the test item 
    is "Client Identifier". Then you'd return "Customer ID".

- Imagine that the list is ["Customer ID", "Order Date", "Total Amount"], and the test item
    is "Date of Order". Then you'd return "Order Date".

- Imagine that the list is ["Customer ID", "Order Date", "Total Amount"], and the test item
    is "Product Name". Then you'd return null, because none of the items in the list are
    semantically similar to "Product Name".

- Imagine that the list is ["Dragonfly", "Butterfly", "Firefly"], and the test item is
    "Lightning Bug". Then you'd return "Firefly".
    
- Imagine that the list is ["Dragonfly", "Butterfly", "Firefly"], and the test item is
    "Spider". Then you'd return null, because none of the items in the list are 
    semantically similar to "Spider".
